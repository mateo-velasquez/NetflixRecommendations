## 📌 Project Overview

This project, titled **Project 2: Netflix Recommendations**, focused on building a graph-based recommendation system using real-world Netflix-style data. I implemented a set of algorithms to analyze user interactions and generate content suggestions.

Specifically, I applied the following techniques:

- **Centrality algorithms** to identify influential nodes (users, movies, actors).
- **Community detection** to find clusters of similar preferences.
- **Similarity measures** to relate users and content based on shared patterns.
- Simulation of **ADD relationships** to represent how user profiles interact with the movies they watch.

## 📊 Output Format

The recommendations were generated and presented in a **JSON-based dashboard**, allowing for a structured and interpretable view of the results.
